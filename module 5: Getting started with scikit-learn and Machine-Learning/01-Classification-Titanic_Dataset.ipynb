    "\n",
    "Hello,\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this hands-on exercise notebook, where we will explore a simple yet comprehensive approach to address the famous Titanic disaster through machine learning. This tutorial covers a complete pipeline, guiding you through data cleaning, feature engineering, model development, and parameter tuning. While this tutorial places emphasis on feature engineering and the classification task, it serves as an excellent introduction to the broader realm of machine learning.\n",

    "## **Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Problem Statement**\n",
    "Before we dive into the technical aspects, let's define the problem we're addressing. The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived or not during the Titanic disaster. This is a classic binary classification problem, where the target variable is binary, representing survival (1) or not (0).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Dataset**\n",
    "We'll be working with the well-known Titanic dataset. This dataset contains various features about passengers, such as age, class, and ticket fare. The dataset is split into a training set (for model training) and a test set (for model evaluation).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Download the Dataset:**\n",
    "Join the competition and download the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data) from kaggle.\n",
    "Make Sure the files are in the same folder as this notebook. "

    "   - Replacing missing numerical values using the median is a common approach. However, given the varying age ranges across passenger classes, we adopt a nuanced approach.

    "Here's a brief overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Class:** A class is a user-defined data type that encapsulates data and the functions that operate on that data. It serves as a way to bundle data and functionality together.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Object:** An object is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity and has attributes (characteristics) and methods (functions) associated with it.\n",

    "- **Methods:** Methods are functions that operate on the data stored in the object. They define the behavior of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Instance:** Creating an instance of a class means creating an object based on that class. Each instance has its own set of attributes, but it shares the methods defined by the class.\n",

    "- Fare\n",
    "- Embarked\n",

    "**Label Encoding:**\n",
    "Label Encoding is a technique used to convert categorical data into numerical format. In this process, each unique category or label is assigned a unique integer. The assigned integers are often in ascending order based on the alphabetical order of the categories. Label Encoding is suitable for ordinal data where the order among categories matters, as it introduces a numerical representation while preserving the ordinal relationships. However, it's important to note that this encoding might inadvertently imply ordinal relationships in non-ordinal categorical variables.\n",

    "**One-Hot Encoding:**\n",
    "One-Hot Encoding is a technique used to represent categorical data in a binary matrix format. Each category is transformed into a binary column, and the presence or absence of the category is indicated by a 1 or 0, respectively. This method is particularly useful for nominal data where there is no inherent order among categories. One-Hot Encoding avoids introducing unintended ordinal relationships and is compatible with machine learning algorithms that require numerical input.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the context of the Titanic dataset:\n",
    "- 'Embarked': {'C', 'Q', 'S'} could be one-hot encoded as three separate binary columns: 'Embarked_C', 'Embarked_Q', 'Embarked_S', with values {1, 0, 0}, {0, 1, 0}, {0, 0, 1} indicating the presence of each category.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, Label Encoding assigns a unique integer to each category, while One-Hot Encoding creates binary columns for each category, representing their presence or absence. The choice between these encoding techniques depends on the nature of the categorical data and the requirements of the machine learning algorithm being used."

    "Here's why we use `fit_transform` for training and only `transform` for testing:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Training Phase (`fit_transform`):**\n",
    "   - During the training phase, the pipeline needs to learn and adapt to the characteristics of the training data. The `fit_transform` method is used to fit the transformers (such as imputers, encoders, etc.) to the training data and simultaneously apply the transformations. This ensures that the statistical properties and mappings learned from the training data are correctly applied to prepare the features for the machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Fitting and transforming the training data\n",
    "   X_train = processing_pipeline.fit_transform(X_train)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Testing Phase (`transform`):**\n",
    "   - In the testing phase, the pipeline has already been fitted and learned from the training data. We want to apply the same transformations to the test data that were learned from the training data. However, we don't want to re-fit the transformers based on the test data, as this would introduce data leakage and compromise the integrity of the evaluation. Instead, we only use the `transform` method, which applies the previously learned transformations without modifying the parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Transforming the test data using the learned transformations\n",
    "   X_test = processing_pipeline.transform(X_test)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "This separation between fitting and transforming ensures that the pipeline generalizes well to unseen data and maintains the consistency of the preprocessing steps between the training and testing datasets. It aligns with the principle of keeping the testing phase isolated from the training phase to obtain reliable performance metrics for the machine learning model."
