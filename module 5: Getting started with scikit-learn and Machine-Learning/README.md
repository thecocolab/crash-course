3. To apply what you have learned. We prepared some notebook to train. 
   - [01-Classification-Titanic_Dataset.ipynb](#)
      This notebook guides you through a comprehensive machine learning approach to address the Titanic disaster. It covers data cleaning, feature engineering, and model development, emphasizing classification. The goal is to predict passenger survival (binary: 1 for survived, 0 for not survived) using the well-known Titanic dataset, which is available for download on Kaggle. 
   - [02-Regression-Prediction_taxi_fare_NYC.ipynb](#)
      This tutorial introduces a regression task: predicting taxi fare amounts in New York City. Covering outlier handling, data cleaning, feature engineering, and Random Forest Regressor training, it guides you through regression analysis. The goal is to predict continuous fare amounts using a dataset split into training and test sets.
   - [AP4-Machine_Learning_and_Brain_Wave_Classification.ipynb](#)
      Explore signal feature selection and model choice considerations, emphasizing diverse machine learning algorithms' effectiveness using the scikit-learn library in neuroscience applications.
